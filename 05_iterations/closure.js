// A closure is a powerful concept in programming, particularly in languages that support first-class functions (like JavaScript, Python, and others). To understand closures, let's break down the definition:

// Key Components:
// Function: A block of code that performs a specific task.

// Lexical Scope: The region of the program where a variable or identifier is accessible. Lexical scope is determined by where the variable or function is defined in the source code.

// What is a Closure?
// A closure is a function that "remembers" the environment in which it was created. This environment includes any variables or functions that were in scope at the time the closure was created. Even if the function is executed outside of its original lexical scope, it retains access to those variables.

// How Does It Work?
// When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters. If the inner function is returned or passed to another part of the program, it "closes over" the variables from the outer function, preserving them even after the outer function has finished executing.

// Example in JavaScript:
// javascript
// Copy
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "I'm from the outer function!";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outerVariable from the outer scope
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction(); // outerFunction finishes execution
closure(); // Logs: "I'm from the outer function!"

// Explanation:
// outerFunction defines a variable outerVariable and a nested function innerFunction.

// innerFunction accesses outerVariable, even though it's defined in the outer scope.

// When outerFunction is called, it returns innerFunction (but doesn't execute it yet).

// The returned innerFunction is stored in the variable closure.

// When closure() is called later, it still has access to outerVariable, even though outerFunction has already finished executing. This is the essence of a closure.

// Sure! Let's break down how the Global Execution Context (GEC) and Function Execution Context (FEC) are created and executed for the given code. This will help you understand how JavaScript handles closures and scope.

// Code:



function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return y;
}

var z = x();
console.log(z);
z();


// Step 1: Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created
// When the JavaScript engine starts executing the code, it creates the Global Execution Context (GEC). The GEC consists of two phases:

// Creation Phase:

// The global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js) is created.

// The this keyword is set to the global object.

// Memory is allocated for variables and functions.

// Variables are initialized with undefined (due to hoisting).

// Functions are stored in memory as-is.

// Execution Phase:

// The code is executed line by line.

// Step 2: Memory Allocation in GEC
// During the Creation Phase of the GEC, the following happens:

// Function x:

// The entire function x is stored in memory.

// Variable z:

// The variable z is allocated memory and initialized with undefined.

// At this point, the GEC looks like this:

// javascript
// Copy
// Global Execution Context (GEC):
// - x: function x() { ... }
// - z: undefined
// Step 3: Execution Phase in GEC
// Now, the code is executed line by line.

// Line 1: function x() { ... }
// The function x is already stored in memory during the creation phase, so nothing happens here.

// Line 2: var z = x();
// The function x is invoked, so a new Function Execution Context (FEC) for x is created.

// Step 4: Function Execution Context (FEC) for x
// When x() is called, a new FEC is created for x. This also has two phases:

// Creation Phase:

// Memory is allocated for variables and functions inside x.

// a is initialized with undefined.

// y is stored in memory as a function.

// Execution Phase:

// The code inside x is executed line by line.

// Step 5: Memory Allocation in FEC of x
// During the Creation Phase of the FEC for x, the following happens:

// Variable a:

// a is allocated memory and initialized with undefined.

// Function y:

// The entire function y is stored in memory.

// At this point, the FEC for x looks like this:

// javascript
// Copy
// Function Execution Context (FEC) for x:
// - a: undefined
// - y: function y() { ... }
// Step 6: Execution Phase in FEC of x
// Now, the code inside x is executed line by line.

// Line 1: var a = 7;
// The variable a is assigned the value 7.

// Line 2: function y() { ... }
// The function y is already stored in memory, so nothing happens here.

// Line 3: return y;
// The function y is returned. At this point, the FEC for x is destroyed, but the variable a is still accessible to y because of closure.

// Step 7: Back to Global Execution Context (GEC)
// After x() finishes executing, the returned function y is assigned to the variable z.

// Line 2: var z = x();
// Now, z holds the function y.

// At this point, the GEC looks like this:

// javascript
// Copy
// Global Execution Context (GEC):
// - x: function x() { ... }
// - z: function y() { ... }
// Step 8: console.log(z);
// This logs the function y itself.

// Output: ƒ y() { console.log(a); }

// Step 9: z();
// When z() is called, it invokes the function y.

// A new Function Execution Context (FEC) for y is created.

// Step 10: Function Execution Context (FEC) for y
// When y() is called, a new FEC is created for y. This also has two phases:

// Creation Phase:

// Memory is allocated for variables and functions inside y.

// In this case, there are no variables or functions declared inside y, so nothing happens.

// Execution Phase:

// The code inside y is executed line by line.

// Step 11: Execution Phase in FEC of y
// Now, the code inside y is executed line by line.

// Line 1: console.log(a);
// The function y tries to access the variable a.

// Since a is not defined in the scope of y, JavaScript looks up the scope chain.

// Due to closure, y retains access to the variable a from its outer function x.

// The value of a is 7, so console.log(a) outputs 7.

// Final Output
// console.log(z):

// Copy
// ƒ y() { console.log(a); }
// This logs the function y itself.

// z():

// Copy
// 7
// This logs the value of a, which is 7.

// Key Takeaways
// Global Execution Context (GEC):

// Created when the script starts.

// Handles global variables and functions.

// Function Execution Context (FEC):

// Created when a function is invoked.

// Handles local variables and functions inside the function.

// Closure:

// A function retains access to its lexical scope, even when executed outside that scope.

// In this case, y retains access to the variable a from its outer function x.

// Scope Chain:

// JavaScript resolves variable references by traversing the scope chain, moving from the inner scope to the outer scope.
